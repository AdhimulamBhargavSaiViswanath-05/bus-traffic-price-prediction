# Improving Bus Service with Predictions for Prices and Passenger Traffic

**Machine Learning Project**

A machine learning–based analytics project focused on predicting **bus passenger traffic** and **ticket prices** using historical data and predictive models. The project also includes an **interactive Jupyter dashboard** to visualize real-time journey insights and trends.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to improve public bus services by analyzing and predicting:
- Passenger demand patterns
- Ticket price variations based on influencing factors

By applying machine learning techniques, the system provides insights into how ticket prices are calculated and how passenger traffic fluctuates over time, helping improve transparency and decision-making.

## 🔍 Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to address the lack of transparency in:
- How bus ticket prices are determined  
- What factors influence passenger demand  

By presenting data-driven insights in a simple and visual manner, the project helps make public transport analytics more understandable to the general audience.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integration with real-time bus data APIs  
- Advanced time-series models (ARIMA, LSTM)  
- Route-level and city-level demand prediction  
- Web-based dashboard deployment  
- Integration with government transport systems
